Easy to use Wordle Solver. Flaunts a minimalist UI and UX. The new implementation is complete for all Wordles and optimizes for minimum tries.

Usage:
- Clone and `cd` into this repo.
- Compile `wordle.c` (uses `math.h` header for entropy calculations so use `-lm` flag with `gcc`).
- After every word suggested, input the feedback from wordle, e.g. `bbygb` for 拘勇拘勇游릳游릴拘勇
- Input `ggggg` to ensure it quits correctly when the word matches.
- If a `floating point exception` is raised, it means you have entered incorrect feedback at some stage.


Example usage:\
`soare`\
byybb\
`bloat`\
bggyg\
`aloft`\
ggggg

Result:\
Wordle 231 3/6

拘游릳游릳拘拘뜦
拘游릴游릴游릳游릴\
游릴游릴游릴游릴游릴

New optimizations significantly reduce the number of steps needed (in most cases).
